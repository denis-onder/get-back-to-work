# GET BACK TO WORK

A Python script which will yell at you once every-so-often to get back to work if VSCode isn't running.

### Installation:

> Note: This has been tested on Ubuntu 19.04. If you are using Arch or something else, please modify the `install.sh` script to use the proper package manager for installing the dependencies for your OS.

- Clone the repo
- `cd` into the folder
- Run `./install.sh`
- Run `gbtw`, and perhaps set the script to run on startup?
